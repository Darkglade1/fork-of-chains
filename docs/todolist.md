- **High priority**
  - New quest / opportunities / events are always high priority.
  - Quest chains are in high demand, especially if they flesh out or highlight a particular unit in the company.
- **Medium priority**
  - Better quest texts for all [training quests](https://github.com/Official-Husko/fork-of-chains/tree/main/project/twee/quest/darko/training). Some are already filled in, like Oral training quests, but most have not been filled in yet.
  - Improvements for the [base quests](https://github.com/Official-Husko/fork-of-chains/tree/main/project/twee/quest/darko), especially for quests written earlier.

## 💻 Code

Check out the [list of issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Official-Husko/fork-of-chains/issues), and see if anything meets your fancy! You can also help by adding content that writers have submitted into the game, via converting them into proper pull requests.

Code reviewers are also very valuable! Check out the pull requests to get started.

> **Be very wary** when introducing new features! The game is designed to be as easy as possible to add content to. Ask yourself:
>
> - Does the feature interact significantly with other parts of the game? Yes? Good! No? May need rethinking.
>
> - Does it increase the complexity of writing further content? Yes? Bad! No? May be good.

## 🎨 Art

See the [image guidelines](https://github.com/Official-Husko/fork-of-chains/blob/main/docs/images.md) for more information about adding images.

- Better icons
  - Icons for sex positions during sex interaction (per race would be great: wolfkin, catkin, etc.)
  - Better icons for slave / slavers / unemployed can be added in the [job icons folder](https://github.com/Official-Husko/fork-of-chains/tree/main/dist/img/job). The slaver icon especially needs improvement.
- More unit portraits (Game needs at least CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 permissions. Cropping is appreciated. If you want specific credit, let us know!)
- Images for certain quests
- Game Icon (replace the current slaver skill icon)
- A banner for the game, to help spread the word
