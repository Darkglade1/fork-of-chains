## üö´ Commonly Requested Features

Currently, the following features are not implemented or high priority. I would like to add them in the future, but they are not a priority.

- **Pregnancy / Breeding mechanics:** Too much conflict with existing content and maintenance.
- **Hypnotism as a mechanic:** Increases micro-management and writing burden.
- **Futas / Herms:** Would require a third variation for many texts.
- **Virginity Tracker:** Too maintenance-heavy for writers.
- **Player gender-swap:** Only available for slaves/NPCs, not slavers.
- **Slaver to slave conversion:** Causes quest and balance issues.
- **Cosmetic customization:** Conflicts with portraits and adds complexity.
- **Dominant bottom / submissive top:** Too much writing burden.

## üñºÔ∏è Images Not Appearing?

If you are playing on Android, this is a known issue. Try the following:

1. [Play the game directly from your browser](https://darkofoc.itch.io/fort-of-chains)
2. Download the game to your device directly, not to your SD card
3. Open your game via `file:///sdcard/` if stored on SD card
4. Use the Joiplay emulator as a last resort

If migrating a save from Itch.io, reset unit portraits in `Settings` > `(Reset unit portraits)`.

---

## üß¨ New Traits

See the [Traits section in the content documentation](content.md#traits) for more information.

---

## ü¶Ñ New Races

A unit has both a **primary race** and a **subrace** (e.g., a werewolf's primary race is `wolfkin`, subrace is `werewolf`).

**The list of seven playable primary races is final:**

- Humans
- Wolfkin
- Elves
- Catkin
- Greenskins
- Lizardkin
- Demons

### Subraces

Subraces can be added if there is enough content support. Requirements include:

- Basic trait info
- Flavor texts
- Trait preferences
- Unit groups
- At least 20 images (10 per gender; more if common)
- Nameset
- Lore
- Bodypart text
- Icon
- Font
- Company (unless rare/extinct): events, quests, rewards
- **Significant content**

See the file for detailed requirements and examples.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Compiling Problems

- Recompile after every edit ([compiling instructions](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#compiling-instructions))
- Open `dist/index.html`, not `dist/precompiled.html`
- Ensure files end in `.twee`, not `.twee.txt`

---

## üõë Error: sessionStorage quota exceeded

- Disable auto-save and use Save/Load to Disk
- Try a different browser (Firefox recommended)
