This document outlines the guidelines for creating content in the game **Fort of Chains: Galvanized**.

This game is envisioned to be a community project, and the content guidelines try to be as permissive as possible. However, there are some minor exceptions due to various reasons.

---

### 🚫 Prohibited Content

> No content involving minors depicted in sexual acts.
>
> I don't care what you do in your own forks, but don't expect me to add it into this one.

---

### ⚔️ ~~Violence & Language~~

> ~~Soften the "kill" word and no excessive violence~~
>
> ~~The "kill" word is a turn-off for many players. It is suggested to soften it, e.g., using "defeat" or do the killing off-screen.~~

### 🔫 No Modern Guns

The game takes place in a medieval era. Magic, swords, and first-generation machinery are abound, but there shouldn't be cars, mobile phones, or modern guns.

---

### 🪶 Submissive Player Content

Content for player characters with the submissive trait is welcome! These should be restricted only to players whose character has the submissive trait, or (even better) have variations depending on whether the player character is submissive or not.

[Example here](project/twee/interaction/Quiver/give_oral.twee), by contributor Quiver.

### 📚 Expanding the Lore

If your story needs a new piece of lore, feel free to add it to the game! Consider also adding a [lore entry](project/twee/lore). Try not to conflict with existing lore to keep the world believable.

---

### 🧬 Adding New Non-Playable Races

Non-playable races can be continuously added to the game, but will remain non-playable. The current set of ten playable races is final and will not increase. If you have some lore behind the race, consider adding a [lore entry](project/twee/lore/race.twee) for them.

See [this FAQ section](faq.md#new-races) for information about playable races.
